# Flashbang

This is a flashbang script that was scripted for FiveM. Basically you just throw it and wherever it explosed it causes any player near it to collapse with some screen effects.

# Installation
1. Download the resource. (NOT THE SOURCE CODE).
2. Place the resource inside of your resources folder.
3. Add the resource name to your server.cfg (start resourcename)

# How to use the flashbang
1. Spawn into the server.
2. Give yourself the weapon named (WEAPON_FLASHBANG)
3. Throw it

# Known Bugs
1. Weapon is named Tear Gas (I don't know metas well enough to fix it)
2. Weapon has smoke on it when thrown (It is another part that I have no idea how to fix)
3. Weapon has a timer to hold it (No idea how to fix that either)
